Interaction using qb-target for easy configuration.

        pedModel = 'a_m_m_business_01',  -- NPC model
        coords = vector3(100.0, -100.0, 29.0),  -- NPC spawn coordinates
        menuImage = 'uwu.png'  -- Menu image for the business
    },
    another_business = {
        usePed = false,  -- Use prop
        propModel = 'prop_bench_01',  -- Prop model
        propCoords = vector3(200.0, -200.0, 29.0),  -- Prop coordinates
        menuImage = 'business_menu.png'  -- Menu image for the business
